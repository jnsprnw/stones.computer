Collection of resources about **post-digital materiality** compiled by [Jonas](https://jonasparnow.com) and [Paul](http://paulheinicker.com/)

The website is mostly powered by Hugo. Some interactive parts are rendered by Svelte. We use `npm-run-all` to run both processes at the same time. Svelte build its script into the assets folder, where it is then loaded by Hugo.
