The [idea of the Anthropocene](https://www.hkw.de/en/programm/themen/das_anthropozaen_am_hkw/das_anthropozaen_am_hkw_start.php) as the new geological era assigns humanity a special role in the Earth's ecosystem. This insight is undoubtedly important, but humanity is not the measure of all things. On the contrary, a view directed solely at humanity is blinding for larger systemic connections. Some theoretical streams, one might gather under the cluster of [posthumanism](https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/posthuman-glossary-9781350030244/), have been propagating this counter-perspective for some time now and are once again being actively recited in the face of contemporary discourse. The aim is to overcome traditional humanistic dichotomies, such as nature/culture and subject/object, and to open them up to new views of the world.{{< fn "1" "how-we-became-posthuman" >}}&#8239;{{< fn "2" "cyborg-manifesto" >}} For this purpose, non-human worlds of experience and knowledge are embraced (see also the concept of [tacit knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge)) or epistemic potentials are sought in non-organic structures.{{< fn "3" "meeting-the-universe-halfway" >}}&#8239;{{< fn "4" "geontologies" >}} Such perspectives make it possible to develop perspectives of non-human and non-organic entities in relation to a human framing.{{< fn "5" "in-the-dust-of-this-planet" >}}&#8239;{{< fn "6" "the-earth-after-us" >}}
