The idea of the Anthropocene as the new geological era assigns humanity a special role in the Earth's ecosystem. This insight is undoubtedly important, but humanity is not the measure of all things. On the contrary, a view directed solely at humanity is blinding for larger systemic connections. Some theoretical streams, gathered under the cluster of posthumanism, have been propagating this counter-perspective for some time now and are once again being actively recited in the face of contemporary discourse. The aim is to overcome traditional humanistic dichotomies, such as nature/culture and subject/object, and to open them up to new views of the world.{{< fn "1" "how-we-became-posthuman" >}} {{< fn "2" "cyborg-manifesto" >}} For this purpose, non-human worlds of experience and knowledge are embraced (see also the concept of tacit knowledge) or epistemic potentials are sought in non-organic structures.{{< fn "3" "unconscious" >}} {{< fn "4" "data-feminism" >}} Such perspectives also make it possible to develop ideas of the earth completely independent of human beings.{{< fn "5" "data-feminism" >}} {{< fn "6" "the-earth-after-us" >}}
