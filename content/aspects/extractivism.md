The natural resources needed for our devices and planetary infrastructures are extracted from various places on the Earth to be traded around the world. However, the artificial process of commodification of raw material and the resulting political and humanitarian issues in these areas of the world are the focus of this aspect. While we cannot cover the whole extensive discourse around extractivism here, we decided to list contemporary voices that show the range of perspectives on this topic. Anna Tsing, for example, shows the complexity of globalised commodity chains that exist shown on the example of the matsutake mushrooms.{{< fn "1" "the-mushroom-at-the-end-of-the-world" >}} Macarena GÃ³mez-Barris and Kathryn Yusoff make us aware of the [political dimensions](https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/4225-a-billion-black-anthropocenes) of geology by pointing at the long and deep history of colonial, racial and Indigenous [pitfalls](https://www.e-flux.com/journal/97/252226/white-utopia-black-inferno-life-on-a-geologic-spike/) as a major aspect of extractivism.{{< fn "2" "the-extractive-zone" >}}&#8239;{{< fn "3" "a-billion-black-anthropocenes-or-none" >}} Similarly, the upcoming book of Denise Ferreira da Silva extends this research by a black feminist voice.{{< fn "4" "unpayable-debt" >}}
