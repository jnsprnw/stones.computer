The beautiful and smooth surfaces of our devices as constant everyday companions influence our emotional worlds in particular. This aspect looks at the different relationships and dependencies of the body-machine relation. Beatriz Colomina and Mark Wigley, first of all, reflect the idea that "good design" should create an undisturbed functionality that clouds the view of the underlying infrastructures or numbs any friction. Both therefore speak of design as "anesthetic".{{< fn "1" "are-we-human-good-design-is-an-anesthetic" >}} On the other hand, Geert Lovink describes how emotions do take place within social media applications and how they are planned and economized. He offers an analysis of rather melancholic phenomena within digital platforms ranging from void after data abundance, toxic memes and addiction.{{< fn "2" "sad-by-design" >}} The last point of addiction is also approached by Natasha Dow Sch√ºll. She examines the origin and effects of addiction processes using the example of machine gambling.{{< fn "3" "addiction-by-design" >}} Furthermore, the whole interdisciplinary field of research of "Affective Computing", originally coined by Rosalind Picard, is concerned with how human affects can be made processible.{{< fn "4" "affective-computing" >}}
