The provision of digital networking, cloud computing and streaming requires an enormous planetary-scale infrastructure, the complexity of which deliberately eludes the eye of the human user. While Tung-Hui Hu draws our attention to the military past and the development of network technologies, artists like Ingrid Burrington show us why these infrastructures are hidden [Link] and how we can make them visible again via traces [Link]. Armin Linke has also been photographically documenting the visual phenomena of this networking through communication technologies for decades.

The new technologies culminate in the urban centers of the world, and smart cities have long since ceased to be visions of the future and have become political reality. [Link] Rem Koolhaas's research project Countryside[Countryside], however, draws our attention to the fact that the critical infrastructures that provide them are and will be located outside the cities in the countryside. Nevertheless, it is important to understand the deep interaction between software and city [Code and City], but not to forget that urban intelligence is more than pure data processing. [City is not a Computer]
