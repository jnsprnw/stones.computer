In the digital society, human ideas and technology mix within complex connections. There is an obvious clash of human and computational models how to abstract the world. Katherine Hayles, for example, researches this digital subject, the [cultural effects](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d009/646e46ae849d535272a5ad4d1a5a75caa514.pdf) of code, and asks whether human consciousness itself might be computational.{{< fn "1" "my-mother-was-a-computer" >}} Wendy Chun operates in a similar mode, using the term homophily to show how the entry of the digital into society favours a greater convergence of the ever-same.{{< fn "2" "queering-homophily" >}} Patricia Reed responds to this with the concept of xenophily as an alternative to anthropocentric conceptions, which makes it possible to denaturalize human habits.{{< fn "3" "xenophily-and-computational-denaturalization" >}} On another ethical level, Louise Amoore arranges algorithms as ethicopolitical instances and opens up what she frames as cloud ethics.{{< fn "4" "cloud-ethics" >}} Many of the so-called [post-internet artists](https://mdbk.de/en/exhibitions/link-in-bio-kunst-nach-den-sozialen-medien/) also work their way through the [emotional](http://algorithmicintimacies.xyz/) worlds that are only just emerging through and despite algorithms. It is precisely in moments of intimacy that fractures become apparent, at which Lee Mackinnon also works her way through.{{< fn "5" "love-machines" >}}
