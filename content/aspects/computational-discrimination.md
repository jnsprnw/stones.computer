The increasing use of algorithms is often not only justified by its higher efficiency, but its results are also attributed to be more just than its human-generated counterparts. O’Neil describes how the underlying models are embedded opinions and historical practices.<sup>4</sup> Benjamin takes this further and enables [counteraction](http://radicalaiproject.org/) by revealing how racism and technology are entangled.<sup>3</sup> In a similar approach, with a focus on AI and its underlying labour, the Nooscope manifest maps out the functioning of such systems to demystify and thus reveal [errors](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/12/google-racism-ban-gorilla-black-people), [biases](https://algorithmwatch.org/en/story/google-vision-racism/) and [limitations](https://fortune.com/2018/10/10/amazon-ai-recruitment-bias-women-sexist/).<sup>2</sup>

D'Ignazio and Klein have a focus on the input [data sets](https://github.com/MimiOnuoha/missing-datasets). How their paradigm »What get countered counts« and purported scientific nature can be questioned.<sup>1</sup>
