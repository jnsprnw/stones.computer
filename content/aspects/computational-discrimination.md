The increasing use of algorithms is often not only justified by its higher efficiency, but its results are also attributed to be more just than its human-generated counterparts. O’Neil describes how the underlying models are embedded opinions and [historical](https://elegantcollisions.com/decoding-possibilities) practices.{{< fn "1" "weapons-of-math-destruction" >}} Benjamin takes this further and enables [counteraction](http://radicalaiproject.org/) by revealing how racism and technology are entangled and led to [pattern discrimination](https://meson.press/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/9783957961457-Pattern-Discrimination.pdf).{{< fn "2" "race-after-technology" >}} In a similar approach, with a focus on [AI](https://ainowinstitute.org/) and its underlying labour, the Nooscope manifest maps out the functioning of such systems to demystify and thus reveal [errors](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/12/google-racism-ban-gorilla-black-people), [biases](https://algorithmwatch.org/en/story/google-vision-racism/) and [limitations](https://fortune.com/2018/10/10/amazon-ai-recruitment-bias-women-sexist/).{{< fn "3" "nooscope" >}}

D'Ignazio and Klein have a focus on the input [data sets](https://github.com/MimiOnuoha/missing-datasets): How can the paradigm »{{< q >}}What get countered counts{{< /q >}}« and the purported scientific nature be questioned.{{< fn "4" "data-feminism" >}} Similarly, Loukissas puts a focus on the context of the creation of dataset and rebuts the {{< q >}}myth of digital universalism{{< /q >}}.{{< fn "5" "all-data-are-local" >}}
