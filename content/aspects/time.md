The appreciation for the materialistic aspects of technological infrastructures goes hand in hand with the discovery of temporal dimensions beyond anthropomorphic and anthropocentric reductions. Whereas we cannot get rid of the former, as we always conceptualise time from our bodily perception, we can at least expand our temporal notion to the geological realities of our environment, following Rosi Braidotti.{{< fn "1" "metamorphoses-towards-a-materialist-theory-of-becoming" >}} In view of the unimaginable millions and billions of years of the geological time scale, captured by John McPhee's concept of deep time, human history seems to be in the blink of an eye.{{< fn "2" "basin-range" >}} However, the aim is not to negate the human dimension of temporality, but to perceive the simultaneously dominant levels of time in our devices, from rare-earth elements to idealistic concepts, to the actual use, as Michel Serres, among others, showed us.{{< fn "3" "conversations-on-science-culture-and-time" >}} Thus, it is not only important to get a feeling for the accelerated time spans of our media consumption (between March and April 2020, over [1.645 billion hours](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21257227/coronavirus-streamelements-arsenalgg-twitch-youtube-livestream-numbers) of live-streams were watched on Twitch.tv), but also for the rather slow environmental temporalities in socio-political contexts, as [Jussi Parikka suggests](https://strelkamag.com/en/article/media-theory-for-terraforming-by-jussi-parikka).{{< fn "4" "a-slow-contemporary-violence" >}}
