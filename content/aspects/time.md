The appreciation for the materialistic aspects of technological infrastructures goes hand in hand with the discovery of temporal dimensions beyond anthropomorphic and anthropocentric reductions. Whereas we cannot get rid of the former, we can at least expand our temporal notion to the geological realities of our environment. In view of the unimaginable millions and billions of years of the geological time scale, captured by John McPhee's concept of deep time, human history seems to be in the blink of an eye.{{< fn "1" "basin-range" >}} However, the aim is not to negate the human dimension of temporality, but to perceive the simultaneously dominant levels of time in our devices, from rare-earth elements, to idealistic concepts, to the actual use, as Michel Serres, among others, showed us.{{< fn "2" "conversations-on-science-culture-and-time" >}} Thus, it is not only important to get a feeling for the time spans of our media consumption (between March and April 2020, over 1.645 billion hours of live-streams were watched on Twitch), but also for the different temporalities in socio-political contexts, as Jussi Parikka, for example, introduces us to through the concept of Slow Violence.{{< fn "3" "a-slow-contemporary-violence" >}}
