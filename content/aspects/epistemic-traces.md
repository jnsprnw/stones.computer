The climate crisis and its events show us the dimensions of anthropogenic destruction. The patterns of Earth revealing itself in environmental disasters can be read as a massive [planetary](https://www.e-flux.com/architecture/accumulation/217051/becoming-planetary/) diagram. However, we cannot just witness climate complexities with bare eyes, but instead we started to model and capture them by various sensing technology that contributes to the emergence of climate emergency as a stand-alone epistemic object. The human-made apparatus of modelling the Earth and its entanglement is, for example, conceptualised by Ursula Heise, Jennifer Gabrys, and Paul Edwards. Another research approach analyses the material affordances of these sensing infrastructures to examine what evidence of violence can be derived from their traces. As a spatial hub for this approach we can name the Centre for Research Architecture based at Goldsmiths in London with director Susan Schuppli and her research practice but also the research agency [Forensic Architecture](https://forensic-architecture.org/) that came out of this centre. There is also a new wave of young researchers tackling this issue by combining it with artistic frameworks, like the project [Geocinema](https://geocinema.network) which re-frames the planetary sensing infrastructure as a form of cinematic thinking.
