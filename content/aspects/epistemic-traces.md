The climate crisis and its events show us the dimensions of anthropogenic destruction. The patterns of Earth revealing itself in environmental disasters can be read as a massive [planetary](https://www.e-flux.com/architecture/accumulation/217051/becoming-planetary/) diagram. However, we cannot just witness climate complexities with bare eyes, but instead we started to model and capture them by various sensing technology that contributes to the emergence of climate emergency as a stand-alone epistemic object. The human-made apparatus of modelling the Earth and its entanglement is, for example, conceptualised by Ursula Heise, Jennifer Gabrys, and Paul Edwards.{{< fn "1" "sense-of-place-and-sense-of-planet" >}}&#8239;{{< fn "2" "program-earth" >}}&#8239;{{< fn "3" "vast-machine" >}} Another research approach analyses the material affordances of these sensing infrastructures to examine what evidence of violence can be derived from their traces as a form of [situated knowledge](https://newmaterialism.eu/almanac/s/situated-knowledges.html). As a research hub for this approach, we name the [Centre for Research Architecture](https://www.gold.ac.uk/architecture/) based at Goldsmiths in London with director Susan Schuppli and her research practice but also the research agency [Forensic Architecture](https://forensic-architecture.org/) that developed within this centre.{{< fn "4" "material-witness" >}}&#8239;{{< fn "5" "forensic-architecture" >}} There is also a new wave of young researchers tackling this issue by combining it with aesthetic frameworks, like the project Geocinema which re-frames the planetary sensing infrastructure as a form of cinematic thinking.{{< fn "6" "geocinema" >}}
