This aspect tries to expand the ordinary notion of media by thoughts that are rooted in Donna Harawayâ€™s notion of naturecultures.{{< fn "1" "naturecultures" >}} The aim is to overcome a simplistic nature and culture dichotomy by emphasising their historical continuity. When read in a medium-specific way we can even talk about [medianatures](www.ctrl-z.net.au/articles/issue-7/russill-is-the-earth-a-medium/), as also emphasised by Jussi Parikka.{{< fn "2" "geology-of-media" >}} By expanding the scope of media, we can thereby include concepts of materiality that point at non-human mediations, like natural elements. John Durham Peters, for example, advocates for environments as media and looks at the long media history of clouds.{{< fn "3" "marvellous-clouds" >}} On another note, with this perspective we can also look at our cultural infrastructures differently. Instead of particular objects and rather as media ecologies, we can appreciate the full cycle of media realities. With this thinking in mind, Shannon Mattern introduces us to 5000 years of urban media.{{< fn "4" "code-and-clay-data-and-dirt" >}} This materialistic reading of a mediatic nature also implies a conception of a full material life cycle that also includes the [afterlife](http://heathermdavis.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Life-and-Death-in-the-Anthropocene.pdf) of most electronic media as e-waste. Hence, Jennifer Gabrys describes the full stack and cycles of technologies.{{< fn "5" "digital-rubbish-pollution-sensing" >}}
