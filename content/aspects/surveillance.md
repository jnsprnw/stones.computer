Modern surveillance as {{< q >}}dominant organising practice{{< /q >}} is (not exclusively) facilitated by digital information technology. Benthamâ€™s panopticon{{< fn "1" "discipline-and-punish" >}} is no longer sufficient to describe the current large-scale, [invisible](https://rhizome.org/editorial/2014/may/20/stealth-infrastructure/) data-gathering and resulting self-censorship. All enthusiastically or resignedly accepted for profit, security or entertainment. Surveillance studies{{< fn "2" "routledge-handbook-of-surveillance-studies" >}} emerged in the need to bring together the myriad aspects involved, also with a particular focus on Blackness{{< fn "3" "dark-matters-on-the-surveillance-of-blackness" >}} and from a feminist perspective{{< fn "4" "feminist-surveillance-studies" >}}.

The development of [tools](https://www.privacytools.io/) and [education](https://www.nytimes.com/series/new-york-times-privacy-project) around [importance](https://www.ted.com/talks/glenn_greenwald_why_privacy_matters) and [practises](https://datadetoxkit.org/en/home/) to [protect yourself](https://ssd.eff.org/) (online) established itself as answer to the tardy political process. One popular aspect that is discussed even among the general public is the usage of [facial recognition](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html), which also triggered [artistic](https://cvdazzle.com/) ([speculative](https://ahprojects.com/hyperface/)) [counter](https://noma-studio.pl/incognito/) proposals.

The research and design studio Metahaven created a seminal work by contemplating on the {{< q >}}involuntary transparency{{< /q >}} through disclosures (in particular by WikiLeaks), its aesthetics, character and geopolitics.{{< fn "5" "black-transparency" >}}
