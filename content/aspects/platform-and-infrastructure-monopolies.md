Platforms form new economic entities by providing infrastructures. These intermediate position profits from network effects, which strives for monopolies.{{< fn "1" "platform-capitalism" >}} This phenomenon is often described as [platform feudalism](https://scholarship.law.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=http://scholarship.law.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1470&context=commlaw&httpsredir=1&article=1470&context=commlaw) as it concentrates power in private hands.{{< fn "2" "freedom-as-a-service" >}} This is especially alarming as few (ever-expanding) companies control critical technologies and services such as AI, social networks and shopping. For example, by controlling both the search and browser market, [Google is dictating standards](https://bilge.world/google-page-experience) that benefit themself and also consolidate dominant interests, and player.{{< fn "3" "algorithms-of-oppression" >}} Zuboff examines these {{< q >}}concentrations of wealth, knowledge, and power{{< /q >}} in the context of capitalism. She describes how these actors create a {{< q >}}ubiquitous computational architecture{{< /q >}} through {{< q >}}means of behavioral modification{{< /q >}} of their users.{{< fn "4" "surveillance-capitalism" >}} This [asymmetrical relationship](https://er.educause.edu/articles/2017/7/pedagogy-and-the-logic-of-platforms/) between user and platforms that are shaping the worlds they only purport to represent is described by Bucher.{{< fn "5" "if-then-algorithmic-power-and-politics" >}}

While consumer-facing services gain attention, significant infrastructural parts of the internet rely on Amazon’s AWS or Cloudflare’s servers. Their political role as a provider ([of what is accessible](https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-we-terminated-daily-stormer/)) is often opposed through ([technological](https://safenetwork.tech/)) [means](https://beakerbrowser.com/) such as [decentralised](https://ipfs.io/) [networks](https://ournetworks.ca/) and *[digital commons](https://www.dezentrum.ch/en/blog/decentralized-digital-infrastructure-towards-digital-commons)*.
