Platforms form new economic entities by providing infrastructures. These intermediate position profits from network effects, which strives for monopolies.{{< fn "1" "platform-capitalism" >}} This phenomon is often described as [platform feudalism](https://scholarship.law.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=http://scholarship.law.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1470&context=commlaw&httpsredir=1&article=1470&context=commlaw) as it concentrates power in private hands.{{< fn "2" "freedom-as-a-service" >}} This is especially alarming as few (ever expanding) companies control critical technologies and services such as AI, social networks and shopping. For example, by controlling both the search and browser market, Google is dictating standards that benefit themself and also consolidate dominant interests and player.{{< fn "3" "algorithms-of-oppression" >}} Zuboff examines this *concentrations of wealth, knowledge, and power* in the context of capitalism. She describes how these actors create a *ubiquitous computational architecture* through *means of behavioral modification* of their users.{{< fn "4" "surveillance-capitalism" >}}
