For a long time we only knew spatiality in the context of political order, embodied by the emergence and strengthening of the nation state. At the end of the 20th century, the further development of economic globalisation, migration movements and new transport and communication media gave rise to fantasies of deterritorialization through a focus on the new virtual spaces. The depoliticized cyberspaces failed, however, due to the reterritorialized structures of post-Cold War geopolitical realities (see 9/11) and the real political relevance of the Internet and its simulated spaces. Already Vilem Flusser saw the complex interactions between living space and simulated space in 1991. In this new simultaneity of a strengthening nation state and the influence of virtual spaces controlled by tech monopolists, new geopolitical systems of order are needed, such as Benjamin Bratton's stack of productive diagrams. In the end, less geodeterminism will probably help, but more geopoesis.
