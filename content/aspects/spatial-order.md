For a long time we only knew spatiality as performative instrument in the context of political order, embodied by the emergence and strengthening of the nation state. At the end of the 20th century, the further development of economic globalisation, migration movements and new transport and communication media gave rise to fantasies of deterritorialisation through a focus on new virtual spaces and according imagery, as analysed by Ursula Heise.{{< fn "1" "from-the-blue-planet-to-google-earth" >}} The depoliticised cyberspaces failed in the end, however, due to reterritorialised structures of geopolitical realities after 9/11 and the actual political relevance of [the Internet](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/opinion/internet-google-china-balkanization.html) and its simulated spaces. Already in 1991 Vilem Flusser described the more complex interactions between actual living space and virtually simulated space.{{< fn "2" "raeume" >}} In this new simultaneity of a strengthening nation-state and the influence of virtual spaces controlled by tech monopolists, new geopolitical systems of order which also include perspectives on developments in Asia Pacific and the Global South are needed. One prominent example is Benjamin Bratton's Stack theory that frames the multiple layers of its accidental megastructure as a result of a planetary-scale computation complex.{{< fn "3" "black-stack" >}} In a similar manner, Kenneth White asks for less entrenched geodeterminism, but suggests more geopoesis instead.{{< fn "4" "geopoesis" >}}
