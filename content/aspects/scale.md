In current occupations, dealing with material questions concerning our technical infrastructures is often accompanied by a change or expansion of our human-centred perspective. Under the aspect of "upscaling", tendencies are gathered that place human beings in relation to a larger planetary scale conditions, like Benjamin Bratton's proposal of a planetary scale computation as foundational theme for the Stack. We also put our conception and idea of the earth itself, for example in the Anthropocene, to the test, for example when Rosi Braidotti claims for a Non-Anthropocentrism. At the end we face the question "for what Earth do we design?" in the sense of Luke Likavcan's introduction to comparative planetology.
