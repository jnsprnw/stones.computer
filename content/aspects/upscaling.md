In current occupations, dealing with material questions concerning our technical infrastructures is often accompanied by a change or expansion of our human-centred perspective. Under the aspect of “upscaling”, tendencies are gathered that place human beings in relation to a larger [planetary scale condition](https://www.e-flux.com/architecture/accumulation/217051/becoming-planetary/), like Benjamin Bratton’s proposal of a planetary scale computation as foundational theme for the Stack.{{< fn "1" "the-stack" >}} We also put our conceptions and ideas of the Earth itself, like the proposed geologic era of the Anthropocene, to the test. John Tresch, for example, shows how cultural techniques and artefacts in the sense of his notion of cosmograms have worked as means to project world views and forms of a visual culture that seeks to understand the planetary condition.{{< fn "2" "cosmograms" >}} On a similar note, Rosi Braidotti and her posthuman conceptualisation help to understand that ecological complexities cannot be understand from a traditional humanistic idea of the subject and, thus, advocates for a Non-Anthropocentrism.{{< fn "3" "the-posthuman" >}} At the end we face the overarching question “for what Earth do we design?”, to quote from Lukáš Likavčan’s introduction to [comparative planetology](http://www.bldgblog.com/2007/12/comparative-planetology-an-interview-with-kim-stanley-robinson/).{{< fn "4" "comparative-planetology" >}}
