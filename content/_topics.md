Colloquially, materiality means that which is essential for the material, i.e. for that which consists of matter and is therefore physically present. This website, however, gathers theoretical as well as practical endeavours trying to frame more of the dialectical relationship between humans and the surrounding material world. Following the latest developments of a new materialism, we are primarily concerned with three material dimensions and their effects. Basically, we start with the actual material conditions of digital infrastructures, then scale up to power and geopolitical questions of the digital and, in the last step, ask for moments of embodiment in the apparently dematerialised digital space.
