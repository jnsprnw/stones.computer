By stones that calculate, we mean all information processing devices and infrastructures of our automated society, whose basic components consist of (rare-earth) elements. From smartphones, internet cables to data centres, we consider the material complexity, cycles and dependencies that it requires to provide the enormous data and energy resources for, among other things, our daily Netflix consumption. Taking into account the effects of both climate crisis and Corona pandemic, we are interested in making visible the connections between ecology, power and information technology.
