By stones that calculate, we mean the assemblage of all information processing devices or infrastructures and their socio-political impact on our automated society. This website is an online collection of resources that maps academic as well as artistic perspectives which reflect <a href="http://www.parrhesiajournal.org/parrhesia22/parrhesia22_horl.pdf">digital conditions</a> within <a href="https://criticalposthumanism.net/new-materialisms/">materialist discourses</a>. We have examined the research field on the basis of three topics from which we later derived sixteen aspects.

This archive is an evolving exercise to provide an entry point and simplified overview for inspiration and further explorations. We keep adding and redefining content. You can help us by submitting your suggestion at the very end of this page.
