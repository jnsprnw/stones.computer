<a href="http://paulheinicker.com/" rel="author">Paul Heinicker</a> is a research associate at the Interaction Design Lab in Potsdam and I currently write my PhD thesis. I received my MA in (Interaction) Design from FH;P in 2015 with distinction. I'm interested in visual culture and how visual artefacts shape the way we see and understand our society. On my blog post data I especially write about the culture and politics of visualisations.
