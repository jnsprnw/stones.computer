This collection is a result of our personal research. We are aware of our biased and limited capacities to create such an overview of the complex discourse of materialist theories and practices. Therefore, we want to thank the people who contributed help and feedback on the creation of this website. In particular, many thanks to <a href="http://www.zem-brandenburg.de/en/sensing/forschungsprojekte/soine.html">Alice Soine</a>, <a href="http://www.merle-ibach.de">Merle Ibach</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/solveigsuess?lang=en">Solveig Suess</a> and <a href="https://www.kimalbrecht.com/vis/">Kim Albrecht</a>. We are grateful also to the Department of Design at the University of Applied Sciences and the European Media Studies at the University of Potsdam for their support.
