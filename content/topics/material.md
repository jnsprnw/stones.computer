The focus here is particularly on the material consequences of digitisation. In contrast to supposed dematerialisation narratives, we are interested in the extended cycles of digital infrastructures. In the sense of opening the black box, this focus looks at the resources needed to keep this planetary-scale computation going. In addition to new spatial orders, altered temporal relations become apparent. Under the concept of deep time, we are also dealing with different notions of the Earth.
